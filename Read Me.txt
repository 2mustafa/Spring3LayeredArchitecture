Using a layered architecture in Spring applications,
where each layer has a specific responsibility:

- DAO Layer: Responsible for data access and interaction with the database.
- Service Layer: Responsible for business logic and orchestrating data access.
- Controller Layer: Responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses, acting as the entry point for web requests.
