Using a layered architecture in Spring applications,
where each layer has a specific responsibility:

- DAO Layer: Responsible for data access and interaction with the database.
- Service Layer: Responsible for business logic and orchestrating data access.
- Controller Layer: Responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses, acting as the entry point for web requests.

1. **Database Configuration:**
    - Configure database properties in `application.properties`.
    - Specify the database URL, username, password, and other relevant properties.


2. **Define the Entity (Employee):**
   - Create the `Employee` entity class with appropriate annotations for database mapping.

3. **Create the DAO Interface (EmployeeDAO):**
   - Define the `EmployeeDAO` interface with a `findAll()` method for data access.


4. **Implement the DAO (EmployeeDAOImplement):**
   - In `EmployeeDAOImplement`:
     1. Define a field for `EntityManager`.
     2. Inject the `EntityManager` using constructor injection.
     3. Override the `findAll()` method:
        - Create a query using `TypedQuery`.
        - Execute the query and get the result list.
        - Return the result list.

5. **Create the Service Interface (EmployeeService):**
   - Define the `EmployeeService` interface with all methods from the DAO interface.


6. **Implement the Service (EmployeeServiceImpl):**
   - In `EmployeeServiceImpl`, inject the `EmployeeDAO` using constructor injection.
   - Implement the methods, forwarding the calls to the DAO.
